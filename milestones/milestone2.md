## Milestone 2

### Link to the [project](https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/project-2023-data-rizzards).


Our website is composed of 4 sections; one being the home and welcoming page and the three others will introduce nice visualizations.

### Race
This section will show, for a given race, how it unfolded (positions of the drivers in time).
To vizualise it, we use svgs for the circuits, from [repository](https://github.com/f1laps/f1-track-vectors).
For a chosen year, for a chosen location/track, we will be able to vizualise the track, as well as the list of drivers and a button start. 

Additional features:
- add a way to select a driver and a track and show how he raced for various years
- add a plot which show more clearly the current position

### Driver
This section will show, for a given driver or a few selected ones, how the drivers' performance evolved over time.

TODO: Include sketch and details.

Additional features:
- using colors, show which teams they raced for

To help with visualization, the library [nivo](https://nivo.rocks/about/), and more specifically the tool [AreaBump](https://nivo.rocks/area-bump/).
Furthermore, the lecture 5 on interactions will be helpful to get more insight on using the mouse to select from multiple choices and layering. The lecture 6 on perception colors and marks will be helpful to show informations using width, colors, and much more.


### Season
This section will show, for each year, a list of teams that participated, the schedule of the races and a flow map showing the movement of the teams during the year.
Furthermore, we add a count of total kilometers traveled as well as an approximation of CO2 emission.
-> lecture 8 is about maps



• Include sketches of the vizualiation you want to make in your final product.
• List the tools that you will use for each visualization and which (past or future) lectures you will need.
• Break down your goal into independent pieces to implement. Try to design a core visualization (minimal viable product) that will be required at the end.
Then list extra ideas (more creative or challenging) that will enhance the visualization but could be dropped without endangering the meaning of the
project.
