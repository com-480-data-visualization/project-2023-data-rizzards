## Milestone 2

Two A4 pages describing the project goal.
### Project visualization
For our project, we want to visualize detailed information about F1 drivers and races. More precisely, we plan to present three different ideas.

#### Race
For a given race, how the race unfolded (positions of the drivers, pit stops, etc.)
To vizualise it, we use svgs for some of the circuits, from [repository](https://github.com/f1laps/f1-track-vectors).
For a chosen year, for a chosen location (must be able to chose one or the other first and the selection change depending what is available) -> output a track with list of drivers (that you can select or not, with a button to automatically select top 5 of the race) and a button start race options:
add pit stops (driver stops for the pit stop duration)
add a plot which show more clearly the current position

#### Driver
For a given driver, how the driver's performance evolved over time, which teams they raced for, how many races did they win, compare them to other drivers, etc.

By selecting a driver -> output:
- plot for wins in time (+total)
- plot for points in time
- constructor they raced for in time
Options:
- possibility to select up to x drivers to compare them
- short description of each driver ?

#### Season
For each year, the schedule of the races, their locations on the world map, which teams participated, etc.

To determine.
An idea: By selecting a year -> output:
- list of races
- world map with locations
- list of constructors
Options:
- show the movement

• Include sketches of the vizualiation you want to make in your final product.
• List the tools that you will use for each visualization and which (past or future) lectures you will need.
• Break down your goal into independent pieces to implement. Try to design a core visualization (minimal viable product) that will be required at the end.
Then list extra ideas (more creative or challenging) that will enhance the visualization but could be dropped without endangering the meaning of the
project.
